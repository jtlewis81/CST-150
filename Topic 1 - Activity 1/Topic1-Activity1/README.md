Per the additional instructions in the announcements, the following has been applied as well:

- Upload all files to github unzipped (do not zip. Githun is powerful and can handle the load)
- Have several screen shots of the application running
  (I will include these in the document uploaded for assignment submission.)
- Make a shot video, loom, screen - o -cast and upload to a video sharing site such as youtube
- Video should have a voice navigation (you talking) not text over lay
