# CST-150
Repo for C# Programming 1 [GCU]

Each week's assignment will have its own folder, which will include its own README.md file containing a copy of the assignments instructions.

The following additional instructions will be adhered to according to announcement posts by the Instructor:

- Upload all files to github unzipped (do not zip. Githun is powerful and can handle the load)
- Have several screen shots of the application running (I will include these in the document uploaded for assignment submission.)
- Make a shot video, loom, screen - o -cast and upload to a video sharing site such as youtube
- Video should have a voice navigation (you talking) not text over lay

1) All variables and methods need to have meaningful names buttonClick_1() is not a meaningful name
2) All methods should have a header comment stating what the method does
3) All Classes should have a header comment stating the purpose of the class
4) There should be comments within the method stating key actions/process
5) All directories in github should have a readme file
6) All assignments need to be accompanied with screen shots showing valid input, invalid input, and different outcomes for different inputs. (At least 3 screen shots)
7) label screen shots appropriately ie. ErrorMsg.png
8) Create a new folder/directory for each assignment
9) label the folder/directory the name of the assignment
10) GUI should have a design scheme other than default (black text, gray background) Give it an appropriate background image (make sure all text and labels are still readable), or apply a color scheme (light background with dark text, or dark background with light text)
