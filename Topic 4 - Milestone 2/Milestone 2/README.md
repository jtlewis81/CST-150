The important files for this assignment are InventoryItem.cs and Program.cs.

Milestone 2 instructions:

This milestone has three parts:

Part 1: Use UML class diagrams to model your inventory item class.

Part 2: Implement the inventory item class.

Part 3: Test the inventory item class.

Deliverables:

A cover sheet with name, date, and assignment title.
A UML class diagram of the inventory item class.
Code that implements the inventory item class.
A driver method or unit tests for the inventory item class.
NOTE: A console application is sufficient to test the class;
however, you may want to make a connection between your high-fidelity
prototype and your inventory item. In other words, display and/or modify an inventory item in your user interface.
